# Installing Tesseract On Crack
### Backup your game before installing!

- First, find one of the releases you want. The latest (non beta) version is pinned.

You'll see TU18, ZMBUILD, and RFAZIO. \
If you're running the normal version of the game, you're using TU18. 

- Download the version you need, most of you will want TU18.
