# How to install custom scripts

### If you want to load a menu or script just like normal Tesseract:
The *hPatch* folder completely replaces the 'raw' folder used by normal Tesseract. \
Instead, put your `maps/mp***` folder in the root of 'hPatch'.

### Installing custom scripts:
Custom scripts load whenever a specific file is loaded. \
For example: `patch_zm`

- To install a custom script, simply drag over the folder into the root of your hPatch folder.
