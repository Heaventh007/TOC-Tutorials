## Features

- All normal tesseract features.
- Fast File overriding.
- Custom texture injection.
- Multiple executables supported.
- Custom patch loader.
- Loading maps from an external directory.
- Loading completely custom gsc files.

## Planned Features
- Custom sounds.
- Custom models.
- Loading custom zone files.

Unfortunately, the texture creation isn't very user friendly. 
It requires a lot of manual work. \
Because of this, You'll need to request a texture to be converted in our Discord: [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/2HwBq3Aqdq)
